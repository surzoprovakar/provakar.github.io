Most secure and efficient oblivious storage systems focus on the utilization of the maximum network bandwidth in serving concurrent accesses via a trusted proxy. However, since the proxy executes a standard ORAM protocol over the network, the performance is capped by the network bandwidth and latency. Moreover, some important features such as access control and security against active adversaries have not been thoroughly explored in such proxy settings. In this paper, we propose MOSE, a multi-user oblivious storage system that is efficient and enjoys from some desirable security properties. Our main idea is to harness a secure enclave, namely Intel SGX, residing on the untrusted storage server to execute proxy logic, thereby, minimizing the network bottleneck of proxy-based designs. In this regard, we address various technical design challenges such as memory constraints, side-channel attacks and scalability issues when enabling proxy logic in the secure enclave. We present a formal security model and analysis for secure enclave multi-user ORAM with access control. We optimize MOSE to boost its throughput in serving concurrent requests. We implemented MOSE and evaluated its performance on commodity hardware. Our evaluation confirmed the efficiency of MOSE, where it achieves approximately two orders of magnitudes higher throughput than the state-of-the-art proxy-based design, and also, its performance is scalable proportional to the available system resources.","tags":[],"title":"MOSE: Practical Multi-User Oblivious Storage via Secure Enclaves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thang Hoang","Jorge Guajardo","Attila A.

S3ORAM (CCS’17) is an efficient active ORAM scheme, which takes advantage of secret sharing to provide ideal properties for data outsourcing such as low client bandwidth, low server computation and low delay.

Unlike previous works, both built-in accelerometer and magnetometer are used to handle mobile installation issues, including but not limited to disorientation, and misplacement errors. The authentication performance is improved by executing deep examination at pre-processing steps. A novel and effective segmentation algorithm is also provided to segment signal into separate gait cycles with perfect accuracy. Subsequently, features are then extracted on both time and frequency domains. We aim to construct a lightweight but high reliable model; hence feature subsets selection algorithms are applied to optimize the dimension of the feature vectors as well as the processing time of classification tasks. Afterward, the optimal feature vector is classified using SVM with RBF kernel. Since there is no public dataset in this field to evaluate fairly the effectiveness of our mechanism, a realistic dataset containing the influence of mobile installation errors and footgear is also constructed with the participation of 38 volunteers (28 males, 10 females). We achieved the accuracy approximately 94.93% under identification mode, the FMR, FNMR of 0%, 3.89% and processing time of less than 4 seconds under authentication mode.","tags":[],"title":"A Lightweight Gait Authentication on Mobile Phone Regardless of Installation Error","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thang Hoang","Thuc D.

In this paper, we introduce gait recognition by using a mobile accelerometer as not only effective but also as an implicit identification model. Unlike previous works, the gait recognition only performs well with a particular mobile specification (eg, a fixed sampling rate). Our work focuses on constructing a unique adaptive mechanism that could be independently deployed with the specification of mobile devices. To do this, the impact of the sampling rate on the preprocessing steps, such as noise elimination, data segmentation, and feature extraction, is examined in depth. Moreover, the degrees of agreement between the gait features that were extracted from two different mobiles, including both the Average Error Rate (AER) and Intra-class Correlation Coefficients (ICC), are assessed to evaluate the possibility of constructing a device-independent mechanism. We achieved the classification accuracy approximately 91.33±0.67% for both devices, which showed that it is feasible and reliable to construct adaptive cross-device gait recognition on a mobile phone.","tags":[],"title":"Adaptive Cross-Device Gait Recognition Using Mobile Accelerometer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Viet Q.

Human activities could be detected based on sensory data that are available on today's smart phone. In this study, we consider mobile phones as an independent device since sending the data to central server can generate privacy issues. Furthermore, applying AR on mobile phone does not only require an effective accuracy rate but also the lowest power consumption. Normally, an AR model learnt from acceleration data of a specific person is distributed to other people to recognize the same activities instead of generating different models individually. This work often cannot create accurate results on the prediction in broad range of participants. Moreover, such AR model also has to allow each user to update his new activities independently. Therefore, we propose an algorithm that integrates Support Vector Machine classifier and K-medoids clustering method to resolve completely the demand.","tags":[],"title":"Personalization in Mobile Activity Recognition System using KMedoids Clustering Algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Viet Q.

With the tendency using machine learning on mobile devices for activity recognition (AR), recent achievements still remain restrictions including low accuracy and lacking of evidences about power consumption of feature extraction and classification. Moreover, keeping constantly a high sampling frequency was the most power consuming factor. In this paper, we contribute a novel method for extracting features in time domain and frequency domain. These features are then classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM). Prototypes of the proposed methods are then implemented on a cell phone to measure power consumptions. To reduce the energy overhead of continuous activity recognizing, we propose an adaptive energy-saving strategy by selecting an appropriate combination of flexible frequency and classification feature for each individual. The self-construct data and SCUTT-NAA dataset are used in our experiment. We achieved an overall 28 percent of energy saving in activity recognition on mobile phone.","tags":[],"title":"Adaptive Energy-Saving Strategy for Activity Recognition on Mobile Phone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thang Hoang","Viet Vo","Thuc Nguyen","Deokjai Choi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1351830535,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351830535,"objectID":"4512b529f9ed5119b8326f6b25bbe126","permalink":"/publication/12_iccais_gait/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T21:28:55-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/12_iccais_gait/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present two approaches for identification based on biometric gait using acceleration sensor - called accelerometer.
